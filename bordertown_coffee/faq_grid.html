<div class="description">
    <h3>Why Isn't all your coffee "fair trade certified"?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Our roaster and importer work exclusively with small farms.
        What this means is that our coffee is bought at above fair trade prices and more of that money gets into the
        hands of the actual farmer, which, in the end, strengthens their community and their business. While we love
        the philosophy behind the fair trade certification, we believe that this is a more ethical system that involves
        an actual hands on approach from our importer. This then guarantees that the system is working. In the end we
        believe this is better for everyone involved, especially the growers.

        <h3>Can I bring my own food or coffee?
        </h3>
        <p>
            We do not allow any outside food or beverage in Bordertown. We still like you, but please leave your own food/drinks outside.
        </p>

        <h3>Why do your hours change during the summer?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Bordertown lives and breathes with the University of Minnesota. During the summer and during school breaks, the majority of our customer base goes home or on vacation. While we hate cutting our hours back, it's something we need to do in order to continue to serve our customers all year long.

    <div class="description">
        <h3>Is there parking?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Sadly we do not have customer parking available. There is street parking in front of our shop and lots of other parking around Dinkytown and the 4th Street Parking ramp is right across 4th.

        <h3>Is Bordertown some kind of Fraternity?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Nope. We are a coffee shop that happens to be inside an old fraternity building.
        </p>

        <h3>Who am I supporting when I buy from Bordertown?
        </h3>
        <p>
            You are supporting the employees who work here. We are a small, independent, non-profit coffee shop, and aside from some of the social justice things we support (like the children's orphanage in Juarez and the various events we have to raise awareness about social issues) all of the money we bring in stays right here. It's that simple.

        Library Room Rental

    <div class="description">
        <h3>Bordertown Library Room
        </h3>
        <p>
            Do you need a space for your group to meet? Whether it's a study group, office meeting, or small class event, we have a free space that can be reserved.

            The best way to schedule the library is to stop in and talk to a barista. They can pull up our calendar and set a date for you.

            If that doesn't work please feel free to call (612) 379-7277 or use our email form (please note, we receive a lot of email so to ensure you get the proper date and time reserved calling is advised).

            We can and do take orders for coffee/food for groups. If you want something made for your group or your own container of coffee just let us know when you contact us and we can go over the options with you.

        <h3>Details & Guidelines
        </h3>
        <p>
            Any group of 4 or more may reserve the library room. If you have less than 4 you may still be in the room but the doors must stay open to allow other customers access.

            The library room may be reserved weekdays between the hours of 7am-11am and 1pm-Close.

            The library room cannot be reserved between the hours of 11am-1pm. During that time we will open the doors in order to maximize our space.  Please Note: Bordertown hours vary over University of Minnesota breaks.  Please confirm that the library will be open for your event during University breaks.

            You may reserve the room for up to an entire semester. We don't carry reservations over automatically so please let us know if you want to continue.  We start taking reservations for the Library room up to a month before each semester starts. (Roughly: In December you can reserve for Jan-May; In May you can reserve for the summer; in August you can reserve for September through December).

            We don't require groups to purchase anything. The room is free to use. We do ask people using the room to support this effort with a purchase. We want to keep the room free to use and this helps us a lot.  We don't allow any outside food or drink in Bordertown.

            Any event that charges attendees must be pre-approved by Bordertown management.  Bordertown is not responsible for any financial loss related to the use of our library.
